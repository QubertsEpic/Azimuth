# Azimuth - A Flight Rewinder

## A program for flight simulator that allows for rewinds.
<br>
This is a rewrite of the Flight-Recorder project by Nguyễn Quý Hy: https://github.com/nguyenquyhy/Flight-Recorder
modifications have been made to it to allow for rewinds.

I'm using this primarily as a learning process for different ways to develop using C#. So, the quality of this particular project may not be the best.
However, I'll be sure to make it do exactly what it should.

###### This looked quite sad being so empty. Have an Dreamliner :)
